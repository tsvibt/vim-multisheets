any D𝘯 is representable like:
<r,f: rⁿ = f² = 1, fr = r^-1f>
an automorphism has to take r to some rotation (assuming n>2) that generates the rotations, and then has to specify where the f goes; then everything else follows.
and this can be done in any way: for any reflection r^kf and any r^j , we have 
(r^j)^n = r^jn = 1
(r^k f)² = r^k r^-k f² = r^kn 1 = 1
(r^k f) r^j = r^k (r^-1)^j f = r^-j (r^k f)

as long as j ⊥ n, this gives an automorphism, and this clearly covers all automorphisms.

when do these come from conjugation?
conjugating by a flip takes r -> r^-1 and r^k f to fr^kff^-1 = r^-k f
conjugating by a rotation r^j fixes rotations and takes f to r^j f r^-j = r^2j f, generally r^k f to r^(k + 2j) f

so any auto that takes r to something other than r, r^-1, is an outer.
among those that take r to r, r^-1, ....  if r to r, what's left is to specify where f goes. if {r^2j | j in [n]} is all rotations, ie if n is odd, then we have all these. otherwise, we only have half, and the others give outers. 
if r to r^-1, from flip r^k f, then f goes to r^k f f f^-1 r^-k = r^2k f. so again if n is odd, we have all, and if not, the others are outer.
