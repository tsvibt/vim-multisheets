if n || m , tn=totient(n). then take the generator to r^km/n, k ‚ä• n. the autos are sending r to r^j for some j ‚ä• m. this sends
r^km/n to r^jkm/n 
now since j ‚ä• m and n || m, also j ‚ä• n; so we've gotten another generator. 
have k, i ‚ä• n. can r^km/n be taken to r^im/n?
i.e. does r^im/n = r^jkm/n  for some j ‚ä• m?
since r^km/n generates {r^m/n}, for some j, r^im/n = r^jkm/n  
is this j ‚ä• m?
we also have j+qn for any q. is one of them ‚ä• m?
if x ‚ä• n and x ‚ä• m/n, then x ‚ä• m
j+qn ‚ä• n since j ‚ä• n, since r^i also generates {r^k}, so that i ‚ä• n, where i‚â°jk mod n
can j+qn be ‚ä• m/n?
if j+qn not ‚ä• m/n, that's because it shares a factor f with m that isn't a factor of n. but if it isn't a factor of n, then adding n will make it not a factor. 
so either j or j+n ‚ä• m? no we could get a new factor
eg m=30 n=5 j=3, j+n=8
let n' be Œ†p^(m_p) for p prime factor of n, m_p maximal p^m_p || m
j ‚ä• n'
n ‚ä• m/n'
so n mod m/n' generates [m/n']
so ng = j mod m/n' for some g
so j+ng 


starting over, ok so... assuming n || m:
let m' = m/n, take any j ‚ä• n. 
we want to construct an automorphism of ‚Ñ§ùëö that takes r^m' to r^jm'
automorphisms are of the form r^i -> r^ik, where k is fixed and ‚ä• m.
so we want some k ‚ä• m s.t. r^km' = r^jm' 
i.e., km' = jm' mod m, which holds when k = j + gn, some g. 

let n' be Œ†p^(m_p) for p prime factor of n, m_p maximal s.t. p^m_p || m

n ‚ä• m/n'
so n mod m/n' generates [m/n']

want j+gn ‚ä• m
have j+gn ‚ä• n' (a shared prime would be in n, so must also be in j, contradicting j ‚ä• n)
suffices: j+gn ‚ä• m/n' since n' * m/n' = m
suffices: j+gn = 1 mod m/n'

since n mod m/n' generates [m/n'], 
ng = j + 1 mod m/n' for some g

so j+ng  is the desired k. so the automorphism exists and all maps are equivalent.
